## Configuration

To configure the database connection, you will need to create a file named `orm.config.json` at the root of the project with the following structure:

```json
{
    "type": "your database type",
    "host": "your database host",
    "port": "your database port",
    "username": "your database username",
    "password": "your database password",
    "database": "your database name",
    "entities": ["src/**/*.entity.ts"],
    "migrations": ["src/database/migrations/*.ts"],
    "cli": {
        "migrationsDir": "src/database/migrations"
    }
}
```

For development and production, it's recommended to use separate environment files. Create a file named .env.development for development and a file named .env.production for production. These files should be located at the root of the project.

# .env.development or .env.production
```js
# Application environment variables.
NODE_ENV=your_environment
PORT=0000

# Database environment variables.
DB_PORT=0000
DB_HOST=https://example.com
DB_NAME=example
DB_USER=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
```
